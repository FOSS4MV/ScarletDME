-------------
Fixed a compiler warning in k_error() - caused by an sprintf() call missing a format specifier.
Added link flags to the Makefile in order to support proper linking under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
Added install and datafiles targets to the Makefile.
The install target will copy the results of the build action to $(INSTROOT)/bin which is currently
/usr/qmsys/bin.
The datafiles target will copy the system data files to $(INSTROOT) and set permissions on the required
files.  THIS WILL WIPE OUT AN EXISTING INSTALLATION!

-------------
Rewrote messages.c : sysmesg() to utilise a directory file version of MESSAGES instead of
a Dynamic file version. Fairly substantial changes in code, but the logic was
duplicated.
Also, obviously, changed MESSAGES into a directory file.

06Aug09 - dat
-------------
Changes MESSAGES 1407 from:
  Error %d (o/s %d) writing record
to
  Error %d (o/s %d) writing record (Possible full disk?)
To provide a useful hint in the event the disk fills up.

-------------
Rewrote the DICT.TOOLS.CLS to cache dictionary and item data for efficiency.
Added a non-sort dictionary list get method and renamed the sorted list method.
Renamed the filename method to set.file.name and itemid to set.item.id.

22Apr09 - gcb
-------------
Added GPL.BP DICT.TOOLS.CLS QMOO class for reading data from a file using dictionaries. There are also methods for getting the dict list, dict count, item-sselect, and item-sselect count. This is preliminary code and needs more work to be more stable and fully featured.

-------------
Added missing @FILENAME synonym for @FILE.NAME to ICOMP and BCOMP.

Added code to _SUM and _SUMALL to summarize only numeric values in the array being passed to the function.

Added TEST account to the workdevbranch1 tree.  This account should be the
home of any test programs or procs that excercise new features.

You can add the TEST account by logging to QMSYS and creating a new entry
in the ACCOUNTS file called "TEST".  Line #1 should look like this:

/<your pathname>/openqm/branches/workdevbranch1/TEST

File it and then run UPDATE.ACCOUNT.  You should then be able to log to the
TEST account without any problems.

-------------
Added SKT$INFO.FAMILY option for SOCKET.INFO to retrieve address family for INET type sockets. 
Return values are SKT$INFO.FAMILY.IPV4 or SKT$INFO.FAMILY.IPV6. 

Added socket option to op_srvrskt() in op_skt.c to enable SO_REUSEADDR. This will allow 
rebinding to address/ports in TIME_WAIT state.

A segfault generating bug was triggered when calling OPEN.SOCKET or
CREATE.SERVER.SOCKET with a malformed ip address.  The routine was correctly
handling the error, but the error check didn't encapsulate to the freeaddrinfo()
call which was attempting to free a null pointer.  (getaddrinfo() failed
properly and never filled out the struct that freeaddrinfo() was trying to
free.

As a result of this, the bug was quashed (thanks for finding it Glen!) and I
greatly increased the ability of the code to detect malformed ip address of
either IPv4 or IPv6.

A new error constant was added (ER_BADADDR), so you should re-run ERRGEN to
update the QMBasic error codes file.

================================================================================

In op_skt.c the routines op_openskt(), op_acceptskt(), op_srvrsck()
and op_srvraddr() have been re-written to incorporate newer network
access methodologies.  This includes the ability to transparently
access both IPv4 and IPv6 network features.

In order to keep error constants that live in SYSCOM up to date, 
you'll need to run "ERRGEN" from GPL.BP to pick up the changes
made to err.h in the C source tree.

ERRGEN has also been updated to incorporate changes that actually
allow it to do it's job.  The original GPL source drop included a 
version of ERRGEN that wasn't updated to work with the new GPL.BP
source tree.  This has been fixed.

You'll need to create a pointer called "CSRC" in order to allow
ERRGEN to access the err.h file that's included in the gplsrc directory.
The VOC entry looks like this:

F
/path/to/your/source/tree
