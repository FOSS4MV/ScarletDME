The Access Control Key
If the menu includes an access control subroutine, the subroutine is called
as the menu is prepared for display for each menu option that has an entry in
this Access line.  The value entered here is passed into the subroutine as a
key to identify the menu option being processed.  The subroutine returns a
status indicating whether the menu option is to be available or not.
