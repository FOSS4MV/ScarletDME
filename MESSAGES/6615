Exit Codes
The optional Exits item is a comma separated list of case insensitive codes
that the user may enter at the menu prompt to exit from the menu, returning to
the process that called the menu (another menu, a paragraph, a program or the
command prompt).

If no exit codes are specified, entry of a null response to the prompt will
exit from the menu.
