Stop Codes
The optional Stops item is a comma separated list of case insensitive codes
that the user may enter at the menu prompt to terminate the menu and all other
active programs, menus, paragraphs, etc.  An abort event is generated and any
ON.ABORT paragraph will be executed before returning to the command prompt.

If no stop codes are specified, entry of QUIT at the prompt will abort the
menu.
