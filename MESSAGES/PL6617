Menu Option Text
The Text item is the text for an individual menu option. The menu option number
will be added automatically.  If the text is wider than the display device
after the number has been added, excess characters are lost.

A menu with all text items short enough to display in half the width of the
display device will automatically wrap into two columns if there are more
options than can be displayed in a single column.

In both single and double column mode, if there are options that cannot be
displayed in the available space, the additional options are lost.
A menu text item that has no associated Action is treated as a sub-heading and
is displayed aligned with the option numbers.
