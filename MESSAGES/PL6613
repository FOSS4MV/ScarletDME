The Access Control Subroutine
A menu can have an associated access control subroutine.  This allows access
to items on the menu to be restricted in any way the application designer
wishes.  Some options might, for example, be available only to certain users.

When an access control subroutine is specified, the subroutine is called for
each menu option as the menu is prepared for display, passing in the access
control key on the Access line of the menu option details.  The subroutine
returns a status indicating whether the menu item is available.
